# Before & After Reporting Tests

These two Maven projects contain a simple test using the [Perfecto Community](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloomfire.android.perfecto&hl=en) app.

The Appium code sample includes: installing the Perfecto Community native app on an Android device (from the Lab repository), navigating within the app, closing and uninstalling the app.

- The test before includes the test without the Reporting components, downloading the single test report as a PDF. 
- The test after includes the same test with the Reporting components.

Before running, make sure to:<br/>
- update the Lab credentials in the test
- register to the [Perfecto community](https://community.perfectomobile.com/)
- update the community credentials in the test
